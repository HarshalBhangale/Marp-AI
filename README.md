# MARP AI - Autonomous Trading System for STRK Tokens


## 🚀 Introduction
**MARP AI** is an **innovative autonomous trading system** designed specifically for **STARKNET (STRK) tokens**. Built during the **Agentic Ethereum Hackathon**, MARP AI leverages cutting-edge AI-driven trading strategies to optimize trading efficiency and profitability in the rapidly evolving STARKNET ecosystem.

## 🏆 Hackathon Project
This project was developed as part of the **Agentic Ethereum Hackathon**, where we tackled the unique challenges associated with **gathering and analyzing STRK trading data**, an area that lacks extensive historical data and infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Multi-Strategy Trading**: Implements multiple AI-powered trading strategies to maximize returns.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Aggregates all possible data sources for STRK, overcoming its limited availability.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Utilizes RL algorithms to continuously improve trading decisions.
- **Autonomous Execution**: Executes trades with minimal human intervention based on AI-generated insights.
- **Optimized for Starknet**: Built with Starknet’s decentralized and high-performance ecosystem in mind.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python** (for AI modeling and strategy development)
- **Starknet** (Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum)
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** (for AI-based trade optimization)
- **WebSockets** (for real-time trade execution)
- **On-Chain & Off-Chain Data Analysis**

## 🔍 Challenges Faced
1. **Data Scarcity**: Gathering comprehensive STRK token trading data was a major hurdle.
2. **Strategy Optimization**: Finding the best mix of AI-driven trading strategies.
3. **Real-Time Execution**: Ensuring low-latency trade execution on Starknet.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- **Improved AI Models**: Further optimization of reinforcement learning models.
- **Expanded Data Sources**: Integration with more external data feeds.
- **User Dashboard**: A UI for monitoring and tweaking trading parameters.
