Folks, right now, Bitcoin continues to struggle as

the election uncertainty is looming over us and

we need this election to be done with

so that the markets can keep moving up.

But Bitcoin has not invalidated the higher highs

and higher lows that it's been building, stair

stepping its way out of the boring zone.

The good sign is that DXY is breaking down and that

is what we've been waiting for and we needed to go

below 100 where it will be full risk on.

But I think within a week's time, with

the election uncertainty out of the way and

the DXY continuing to break down, that's going

to be good for Bitcoin and the altcoins.

So we have to be patient guys.

It's annoying, I know, but we got to be patient.

And one thing's for sure, the

smart money continues to buy.

We're seeing epic buying of bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs

by the Wall Street Bitcoin ETF issuers like BlackRock.

So Matthew Siegel of Vanek highlighted that the first state

pension fund Ethereum ETF state of Michigan files a 13F

disclosing new ETH ETF holdings becomes a top five holder

of ETH and ETH E incredible stuff folks.

We are seeing massive adoption.

Eric Balchunas waiting on the news adding the following

not only did Michigan's pension buy ether ETFs but

they bought more than they did of bitcoin ETFs.

$10 million versus $7 million.

This despite bitcoin being up a

ton and Ether in the gutter.

Pretty big win for Ether which could use one.

So folks, smart money buys the dip, right?

They buy the lows and sell the highs.

Unfortunately people who are not financially educated who

don't understand markets and cycles and charts and

so Forth, they come in with the dumb

money crowd buying the top.

But this, one could argue, is a great position to take.

For eth, it is down significantly.

You look at the ETH

Bitcoin chart, Ethereum is bleeding.

You look at the Solana ETH

chart, eth is bleeding, right?

But it will have its day and

so will many, many other altcoins.

So we have to be patient.

We have to take our positions and pay

attention to the charts, pay attention to the

fundamentals and the macros, not our emotions.

So this is very bullish, guys.

And remember game theory.

One state does it, you're going

to see many others follow suit.

And then you could eventually see the federal

government add Bitcoin to its balance sheet.

So that is a proposal Donald Trump

and Senator Cynthia Lummis have put forth.

Now check this news out. This is massive.

Robinhood, Kraken, Paxos and other crypto firms

are launching a stable coin in Ethereum

called Global Dollar, or usdg.

Folks, the stablecoin market is heating up.

You of course have Tether, which is the market leader.

You have USDC, which is the second largest.

You have PayPal's PUSD Ripple is

on the way with an RLUSD.

Now you have Robinhood, Kraken and

these folks launching their own stablecoin.

Remember, we heard rumors of this about a month ago.

So it is amaz was taking place and

recently stripe acquired bridge for $1.1 billion, which

bridge is a stablecoin infrastructure company.

And that was the largest acquisition in

crypto or in the crypto industry ever.

So amazing stuff.

Let me give you some details here.

And by the way, I'll be interviewing the CEO

of Paxos very soon, so of course I'm going

to ask him about all the details here.

So the USDG stablecoin is issued out of Singapore

by Paxos and is broadly in line with the

with the monetary authority of Singapore's upcoming stablecoin frame.

Income derived from USDG's reserves will be

shared among the initial global dollar network

partners, which are Anchorage Digital, Bullish, Galaxy

Digital, Kraken, Nuve, Paxos and Robinhood.

Some very big names here and it makes sense

that they are collaborating and forming this super stable

coin, if you want to call it that. So.

But they are doing it out of Singapore and it

could be they are waiting for clarity here in the

United States, but it will be very easy for them

to push it through to the United States.

This is all on blockchain, right?

So it's not hard.

So Very fascinating.

So Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla said this is

meant to be really a community token.

Anybody can join the global dollar

network and accrue rewards for activity.

We're distributing something like 97% of the economics.

That's a big difference from how other stablecoins

have been set up and created to date.

So folks, the competition is heating up and

that's good for consumers and users, right?

It puts everyone on their tip of their

toes that they have to do things right.

They have to make sure their eyes are

dotted, their T's, boss, and much more.

And like I said, I'll be interviewing Charles very

soon, so I'll get you all the details.

Make sure you're subscribed.

Folks, real quick word from

our sponsor before we continue.

And that is Bitgo, which is one of

the top tier crypto custodians in the industry.

Bitgo is headed up by Mike Belshi,

Who's a Web 1.0 and 2.0 legend.

BitGo provides many great custody services,

wallet services and much more.

Some of the companies that work

with them include Bitstamp Exchange, Pantera

Capital, that's Dan Morehead, Sui21 shares.

So Bitgo helps the custody some of the

Bitcoin and ETF assets for 21 shares.

And Nike uses BitGo's wallet service for their NFTs and

they also have a self hosted wallet for retail.

So you can check that out.

And Bitgo has been around for

many bull and bear market cycles.

They have insurance, they're trusted and much more.

So if you'd like to learn more, go

to bitgo.com link will be in the description.

Now check this news out.

Europe's largest telecom provider, Deutsche Telekom, to

test bitcoin mining for surplus energy.

Guys, the adoption that we are seeing is

mind blowing and it makes me so bullish.

And this is from their website, an

official press release from their website.

Guys, incredible.

And I am waiting to see more

companies, especially energy companies do this.

As bitcoin mining becomes a way to monetize wasted

energy or blow off top energy and surplus energy.

And I think it makes economic makes sense and

I know regulations are usually one one aspect but

I think we're going to see some very big

names jumping into the mining business.

Guys, it's going to be fascinating but

I mean come on, this is incredible.

You have ETFs, you have companies putting Bitcoin

in their balance sheet, you have countries buying

bitcoin as a reserve asset and you have

companies looking to mine it.

And Even energy companies using looking to

mine it with their surplus energy.

So incredibly bullish stuff.

Now guys, tomorrow of course is election day and we

know crypto has been the big spender in this election

cycle and many anti crypto people are losing in the

polls and they're going to lose in the elections.

We started seeing this on Super Tuesday and as well

as the primaries and you know, there's reports that this

upcoming Congress will be the most pro crypto ever.

Well, the crypto industry is not stopping here guys.

They're continuing to donate money.

Coinbase recently donated another $25 million.

Well, Chris Dixon of A16Z said today we're contribut

over $23 million in additional funds to Fairshake and

its affiliate packs for the 2026 midterm election cycle.

No matter what happens on election day, we are

taking a long term approach to our policy efforts.

So you come against crypto, you're going to lose.

The industry is not putting

up with the nonsense anymore.

And in a way, Elizabeth Warren and Gary Genser,

their nonsense anti crypto army garbage in a way

really brought the crypto industry together to fight back

against those people who clearly are puppets from the

TRADFI incumbents trying to slow these startups down and

they are spending and they're fighting back.

And we got more members of Congress, we got

bipartisan support of crypto and legislations around the corner.

So this is incredible stuff.

Now speaking of Elizabeth Warren, remember we covered,

I think just a couple days ago that

Paul Groll of Coinbase highlighted that they sued

the FDIC to get the FOIA request of

documentation around operation choke point 2.0.

Well, the judge moved in quick order here and

Paul says in record time, the judge in our

FDIC FOIA case has ordered the agency to produce

the operation choke point 2.0 pause letters.

We appreciate the court's consideration.

Some much needed sunlight is on its way.

And folks, as I've been telling you

all, I spoke to people in D.C.

and they told me about what took place.

This is all Elizabeth Warren.

I know some people are like, oh, it was Biden too.

Biden is just following Elizabeth Warren because he cut a

deal with her for her to drop out of the

primaries and to give her this financial oversight job.

And she positioned her people like Genser and the

SEC and she positioned people the treasury and the

Fed and much more and they were doing her

bidding and the whole anti crypto army nonsense.

But now it's going to get exposed

and there's going to be some Lawsuits.

I think the Biden administration

really screwed up here.

And Elizabeth Warren, I tweeted about it the other day,

many Democrats are going to be angry at her because

she bamboozled a whole bunch of them to do this.

And now they're going to feel it in the elections.

They're going to lose out on

campaign donations and much more.

So it's over for them.

And here, you know, we often talk about crypto

as a global movement, a global asset class.

And here, Pakistan is looking to legalize crypto

with new amendments to the SBP Act.

So we are seeing countries around the globe, some

of which we don't usually hear about, and they

may be small, there may be big.

And it's just fascinating.

They're putting crypto legislation in order.

So I hope you see what's happening here.

They're not banning it, they're not outlawing it.

They're putting the guardrails in place.

They're allowing it to grow and flourish.

And that's coming here for

the United States, obviously.

And you're seeing ETFs being issued globally

and many on and off ramps.

Big companies getting involved. It's. It's incredible.

I hope you see what's happening. I hope you're bullish.

I hope you're not investing with your emotions and looking at

the price and saying, oh, man, my coin is down. Oh, no.

Right.

Patience, patience, patience, patience.

Now, when it comes to investing,

there are various factors, right?

You have to diversify.

You can't put all your eggs in one basket.

You have to look at the macro.

You have to look at the fundamentals.

So you can't just blindly say, oh, I like this coin.

And you can't have religious

emotional attachments to a coin.

I've learned that.

And when I moved past that, I

was able to finally make money.

Because it's not about how I feel or what someone

is necessarily telling me, but I studied the data, I

look at the charts, I look at what's going.

And if people are using conspiracy theories as their

investment thesis, you better stay far away from them.

Guys, use data.

That's the important thing.

And you can go review that data. I.

I often try to share as much as

I can here with you and in.
