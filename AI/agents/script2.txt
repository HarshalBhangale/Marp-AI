The bulls are back in control as Bitcoin hits $70,000.

I want to share the charts with you and

what I'm seeing as well as some very interesting

price predictions from the Wall street crowd and institutions.

And Gary Gensler gets asked about losing his job after the

election and I want to share the answer with you.

In addition, the crypto industry sent a whole bunch

of amicus briefs in different crypto cases today.

I think they sense Genser is going to

be out, so they are punching back.

I'll share the details.

Let's get into it.

Foreign hey everybody.

Folks, we got to talk about bitcoin.

It touched 70k once again.

We're waiting for a full breakout

through 70k to surpass 71k.

But, but as I've been sharing with you

guys, we are seeing higher highs and higher

lows being set up here on this chart.

It's looking bullish now.

There's no guarantees, there's no certainties.

We don't have a crystal ball, black

swan events can happen and so forth.

But if everything goes according to plan, this

thing could move up this week, breaking through

7172k which will be very bullish.

That will be some key resistance levels

that it will be breaking through.

And then bitcoin can enter into price discovery and of

course the liquidity will start flowing to the altcoin.

So guys, things are looking, looking really good here.

From the DXY standpoint, the DXY overbought.

It's about to collapse.

This is not a sustainable zone for it to be in.

This will help bitcoin and risk assets to pump.

So very, very bullish.

And as I've been telling you guys, once the election's out

of the way, a lot of uncertainty will be removed and

it's going to be very good for the markets.

We've seen this historically.

No matter who becomes president, bitcoin is not

correlated to the Republicans or the Democrats.

It's correlated to money printing, to

the basement of currency global liquid.

And we've seen bitcoin pump under Obama, under Trump,

under Biden, and if Trump gets into office now,

or Kamala Harris, whoever, it will pump again.

So it's not correlated to those things.

Now, I do want to caveat by saying that

Donald Trump would be better for crypto businesses in

the United States because he has a clear agenda.

He wants to kick out Gary Gensler and so forth.

So let's keep it real, right?

But from a asset price standpoint,

it doesn't matter who becomes president.

They both run the money printer.

If you understand these things things and you're

not totally gaslighted by political talking points and

you understand the factors and the fundamentals behind

markets, you understand what I'm saying.

So we are seeing a very bullish setup

here, folks, and I'm very excited to see

what happens in the coming weeks.

Now we got some additional details

about that university called Emory, which

had bought $15 million in Bitcoin.

Eric Balchunas, who's a senior ETF

analyst at Bloomberg, said Emory University

reported $15.8 million worth of Bitcoin.

The first endowment report, a

spot Bitcoin ETF position.

With that, every institution type is now

represented in the Bitcoin ETF 13F filings.

Endowments, banks, hedge funds, insurance companies,

advisors, pensions, PE Holding Co, VCS,

trusts, family offices, brokerages.

So they all have exposure to the Bitcoin ETFs folks.

And he said absolutely insane feat for a category that

is less than a year old, akin to winning all

four tennis Grand Slams before their 16th birthday.

Folks, there is incredible demand for bitcoin.

And wait till we have more ETFs around

altcoins and the market is educated about those

altcoins and what they do and so forth. Right.

I think we have to give that some time.

You see, the Ethereum etf, while it has been

a success, is not as successful as bitcoin because

bitcoin has the brand, it's well known and it

has a very strong use case of being a

hedge against the debasement of currency.

Now he says here the btc see and this is the

ticker symbol for grayscale quietly moving up in the charts.

Now in the sixth place, nipping at Bitby's heels.

That's BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF.

All told, Grayscale now has a positive net flows in

the past few months as a company in this category.

There's a long history of ETFs of this low

cost mini me move working and it worked again.

So we are seeing a lot of buying, a

lot of liquidity and the charts are aligning and

I think the folks on Wall street recognize this.

And here Vaneck's Matthew Siegel, who I had on

the podcast earlier this year, he went on CNBC

and made a statement about his price prediction for

Bitcoin at $3 million by 2050.

Let me play the clip for you.

We have a model that assumes that by 2050, this

is very long term, that bitcoin becomes a reserve asset

that's used in global trade and held by global central

banks at a very modest 2% weight.

And in that model, we arrive at

a $3 million price target for bitcoin.

Now, that sounds extreme, but that's a 16% compound

annual growth rate for a couple of decades.

You know that, that's not really that extreme.

So into the millions over the

medium term is high conviction call.

Okay, so he's basing his thesis that bitcoin

will become a global reserve asset by 2050.

Now, if it does indeed become that, definitely

3 million is not off the table.

When you think about the supply, demand, economics, the hard

cap in the supply, and bitcoin becoming this asset that's

being held by central banks and so forth, I think

this is a very good prediction and the timeline is

realistic versus him saying, you know, next two years, $3

million, that would be ridiculous, right?

So I think this is.

This definitely makes sense.

This is why there's some bitcoin I'm holding.

I'm never selling, I'm just keeping it.

Now, the majority of it, I will

be using the cycles, take profits. Right?

I've told you guys my strategy.

Take some of that money and reinvest

it in bitcoin and altcoins in the

bloody bear market when everybody's scared again.

And then taking some of that money to pay off debt and

then the profits now and to pay off debt and then spend

some of it, of course, you know, some lifestyle chips.

So very interesting price prediction here from Matthew.

And here Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald,

which is a major Wall street firm.

Howard is of course, part of Donald Trump's transition

team and he was at the bitcoin conference.

He's bullish.

And let me play the clip for you. What he had to say.

He was interviewed on the Anthony Pompliano podcast.

I have hundreds of millions of dollars.

Okay, okay.

Hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars exposure

to bitcoin and it will be billions.

So big statements coming from a billionaire and head

of a major Wall street firm saying he owns

hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin

and it will eventually grow to billions.

Now, may have heard Howard say is

about tether that they have the reserves.

He said this at Davos at the beginning of

2024 and he's, he said that Cantor has done

the auditing of the reserves of Tether.

So you're seeing some of the biggest players in

the world on Wall street and so forth.

Just getting involved in crypto,

guys, it's pretty amazing.

Now a great place where you can buy bitcoin

and all the top altcoins is on Uphold.

This is a platform I've been I've used since 2018.

They have 300 plus cryptocurrencies on their.

It's a pretty unique platform where you can go

between gold and crypto and fiat and so forth.

It's pretty amazing.

And they have a great app, a great platform

that makes it easy to do all those things.

And another great part of using Uphold is that

they are 100% reserved, so they don't commingle or

lend out your crypto funds and they have a

transparency report that you can review.

They also have a great product called USD Interest

accounts where you can park your dry powder or

your crypto profits and earn 4.9% APY.

And there's no lockups, there's no monthly

fees and it's FT DIC insured.

So if you'd like to learn more about

Uphold, visit the link in the description Now.

Scumbag regulator Gary Genser was interviewed at Money20

20 and the question was asked, will he

be replaced or is he afraid he might

be replaced after the election next week?

He said, I sleep fine at night.

Gary's out.

He is out.

And I think even if Kamala Harris

wins, their team has said they would.

They're going to kick him out.

Because look, already the Democrats in the House and

the Senate have turned on him and Elizabeth Warren.

So the jig is up, right?

Him and Elizabeth Warren are

on an island by themselves.

So this guy can't be gone soon enough.

But the thing is, you know

what's going to happen, right?

He's the Wall street rat that's

running through these government agencies.

Remember he was at the CFTC back in

like 2008, 10, 9, 10 and so forth.

And he was called out for, you

know, crap that he did then.

And then later on he got the SEC job, right?

So watch that he, watch, watch him disappear for a

couple years and then all of a sudden he gets

a nice, maybe the treasury jobs that he covets so

much he wants to take Yellen's place, right?

But this guy's pathetic, man.

I hope he doesn't get Another government job.

He's a scumbag for sure.

Now the crypto industry all of a sudden today, guys,

we got a bunch of amicus briefs being filed in

some of these different crypto lawsuits against the sec.

I think these crypto companies sense the weakness.

They change. That's coming up.

And it's a smart move to do this now.

So the Crypto Council for Innovation and the

Blockchain association are stepping up to support BIBA

and the Defi Fund challenging the sec.

So this has to do with airdrops, right?

The SEC trying to, trying to say that air, crypto

airdrops, if you got them for free, are securities.

That's nonsense.

They said today we filed a joint amicus

brief to argue that airdrop tokens are not

investment contracts and don't qualify as security offerings.

And they're not the only ones because Coinbase

also jumped in with it saying today Coinbase

filed an amicus brief on behalf of the

Baba collection and the Defi education Fund to

stop the destructive regulation by enforcement campaign waged

by the SEC against law abiding American companies.

Most destructive of all is that the SEC itself

can't even make up their mind about they, they

claim the law, what they claim the law is.

So I don't, once again, I

don't think this is by coincidence.

The timing I think is smart on their part.

Now, final news item here and not so good news item.

It's about Solana's Phantom wallet.

So Solana's Phantom wallet faces downtime

causing inaccurate account balances for users

during anticipated grass airdrop.

So that's not good.

We can't have these things if we

want the next billion users coming in.

So Solana has had a lot of issues, a lot of downtime.

Now to be fair, they haven't.

The blockchain itself has not had

any downtime in the recent months.

Well, I should say, I shouldn't say recent months.

I think in maybe about eight to 10

months, which is a good thing, right?

But the fact that your biggest wallet

phantom is experiencing downtime, that's not good.

So hopefully they're able to resolve these things.

But they said the, the issues were

quickly resolved but still not good.

You know, and, and don't get me wrong, things can

happen from time to time, but there just seems to

be a lot of downtime that, that follows Solana.

And while it has incredible speed, you

know, are they sacrificing performance and latency

because they're trying to be super fast? Right.

Again, you got to find a balance.

So I don't know how many of you use the Phantom Wallet.

I've used it in the past.

I don't use it on a day to day basis.

So I didn't even know this

happened until I read the news.

So let me know if you

guys, you know, experience the downtime.

But this is not good for sure.

And look, I know that there has to be

further iteration and development from these different blockchain companies

and so forth, so we'll get there.

But Solana just seems to have a lot of these.

And, and I interviewed somebody from the Solana

foundation recently and we, we talked about this.

So look, as long as it's maybe not a detrimental

downtime if it went down for like five minutes, okay.

But if it's down for hours and

days or whatever, that's come on, right?

We can't have that.
