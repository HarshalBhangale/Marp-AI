This is insane news.

Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy

are raising $42 billion.

Yes, billion to buy Bitcoin.

I'll share the details with you.

And the United States treasury makes

some very bullish statements about stablecoins.

They put out a full report today

on crypto, blockchain, stable coins and tokenization.

I'll share the details there.

And another player has filed for a Solana Spot etf.

Let's get into it.

Hey everybody.

Folks, we have some very interesting news

coming out from the US Treasury.

Here are some statements from just today.

We plan to conduct weekly liquidity support buybacks

of up to $4 billion per operation.

In addition, they said we expect to buy up to

$30 billion in off the run securities for liquidity support.

Janet Yellen is doing stealth QE folks.

You know what this means?

Liquidity will rise in the United States.

It's already been rising globally.

We see China's been doing economic stimulus.

You may say, what the hell does

this have to do with crypto?

What have we seen folks?

The correlation between the rise of

global liquidity and asset prices.

The more they debase the currency, the more

to print it will drive asset prices higher.

I don't make the rules.

This is what's been going on, why asset prices

have been going nuts even if the economy is

not doing well because it's going off.

The money printing that's being done by

governments guys and markets are forward looking.

They see what's on the horizon.

And as I've been saying, they're going to have

to go back to full QE quantitative easing sooner

than later because they're cutting the rates.

And how are they going to pay for all of this? Right?

They have to print money.

So that will drive asset prices up.

So this is very bullish.

I'm not saying I agree with what they're doing.

I'm saying this is bullish for asset

prices, if you understand what I'm saying.

And this is why Paul Tudor Jones, billionaire Paul

Tudor Jones went on TV just last week talking

about it's going to be a melt up, right?

They're going to inflate their way out of this

problem that they're in because there's no other solution

to the fiat currency problem unless they adopt a

blockchain model with maybe a hard asset like bitcoin.

But you know that we're far off from that.

But until they make a change, this is the status quo.

We have to keep printing.

And I've talked to you guys

about the boom and bust cycles.

We are coming out of a bust cycle.

We're headed into the next boom.

That does not mean there won't be volatility

or mini market crashes along the way. There will be.

Right.

We've seen that markets don't go up in a

straight line, but if you have a long term

outlook, you know how this story ends.

You look at the stock market chart,

you look at the bitcoin chart.

Higher highs, higher lows.

We continue to make new all time highs

and that's what's going to help drive Bitcoin

and altcoin to new all time highs, folks.

Now in addition to that, we got the

treasury making very big statements about stable coins.

They said stable coins are boosting

demand for US treasury bills.

And I tweeted out about this.

This type of narrative being put out there

means stablecoin legislation is right around the corner.

Very bullish news, guys.

So stablecoins seem to be increasing the demand

for short term United States government bonds known

as treasury bills, according to US Department of

Treasury meeting minutes published on October 30.

In an October 29 meeting, the US Treasury's

borrowing advisory Committee weighed the benefits of stablecoin

adoption and treasury bill tokenization, with one member

suggesting the US Create a permission blockchain for

T bills, the Minute said.

Now they also released a massive report today

that covered a variety of things, but in

it was a big section on crypto.

Specifically it was titled Digital

Assets and the Treasury Market.

And folks, I tweeted out about this.

I'll put a link in the description so

you can go read through this PDF.

It's amazing what's in here.

It covers tokenization, stablecoins, crypto, bitcoin, all

everything that you can think of.

It is amazing.

This is the future and they

have to start paying attention.

They have to take notice and of course they're going

to regulate it and incorporate it into the economy.

Folks, everything will be running on blockchain tokenization, as

Larry Fink said, is the future of finance.

So I'll put a link in the description.

It's too much for me to cover in a podcast.

Some of these slides are very in depth, right?

It's too Much to read off but go check it out.

Link will be in the description.

Now bitwise, CIO Matt Hogan was on Yahoo.

Finance and he said I think

we're going above $100,000 on Bitcoin.

He said, I think this is the

best time to invest in bitcoin.

So of course Matt, I've had

him on the podcast many times.

Other institutional investors recognize what's happening here and

the liquidity cycle, the post election pump and

seasonality and all these things are aligning for

the continuation of the bull market.

Guys, I'm very excited.

Things are looking really great.

That does not mean we won't see volatility.

So just be prepared, have a long term outlook.

Of course personally I think the blow off top could

come by the middle of Q2 or end of Q2.

So we got to watch out for that. So have a plan.

Know where you're going to take profits.

And remember the liquidity will

FL mostly into bitcoin first.

Bitcoin does its big pump.

It draws in the media attention it draws in retail.

Altcoins start to move.

Don't get blinded by the euphoric phase.

Stick to your plan.

Know what price points you're taking. Profit.

If you are taking profits, right?

Some of you may be holding long term.

You're not really going to take any profits now.

But just for those of you who are, you

know, make sure you have a plan written down.

And guys, a great place where you can buy crypto

and also sell your cryptos on Gemini Crypto Exchange.

It's one of the exchanges I've been using for years.

They have many great products such as

a fully functional exchange and app.

They have staking, they have a credit card,

they have a stable coin called Gemini$.

They also have a Web3 creative studio and Gemini

has been around for a long time and they

are headed up by the Winklevoss twins.

They are certified, regulated and licensed.

They're available in 70 plus countries.

And folks, if you sign up with my

link in the description you can get 15

in Bitcoin when you trade your first 100.

So visit the link in the

description to learn more about Gemini.

Now guys, here's the big news of the day.

Michael Saylor, who I've called the biggest bitcoin

bull of all time, he announced today that

they have a plan of raising $42 billion,

not million billion to buy more bitcoin.

Look, the plan has been working

very well for them, right?

It has paid off significantly.

As I've stated many times.

I was worried about MicroStrategy in 2022 with that bear

market and all the debt he raised to buy Bitcoin.

But he made it through, thankfully, and

this is going really well for him.

You see now that all Wall street wants

bitcoin, they have the ETFs, other companies are

adding it to their balance sheet.

So micro strategy, way ahead of the curve.

It's paying off well for Michael Saylor here.

And this plan is insane, man.

I mean, my goodness, this is crazy.

But I think he sees the writing on the wall, right?

You have BlackRock and all these

institutions buying up tons of bitcoin.

You have presidential candidates like Donald Trump and members

of the Senate like Cynthia Lum is proposing the

United States at Bitcoin as a Treasury reserve asset.

The buying is happening globally where different

countries are buying it, different companies in

different countries are buying it and putting

on their balance sheet.

So there's even more conviction now.

So I understand why he's making this move now.

As always, I Hope him and MicroStrategy are not

getting too far ahead of their skis and they're

keeping it balanced because you get too levered, you

get too much leverage in the system and it

increases your risk because you know something could happen,

unforeseen situations where it could collapse the whole thing.

And I'm just speaking from the outside, I don't

know all the details, but I hope that they're

doing their due diligence and not being too greedy

and we've seen what too much leverage can do.

Now, I'm not comparing Michael to, let's say, what

the bankers did to the real estate market in

the housing market in 2008 at all.

But it can get there if you get

too greedy, you know what I mean?

So hopefully everything's buttoned up here now.

Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, tweeted out the following Today,

he said, we get the US election results in

six days and no matter how you slice it,

it will be the most pro crypto Congress ever.

But we're not slowing down post election.

Today I'm announcing that Coinbase has committed another

$25 million to support Fair Shake Pack, which

they will use leading up to the 2026

midterms to elect pro crypto candidates.

We're also supporting Stan with crypto in

their stretch goal to reach 4 million

advocates by the 2026 midterms.

The crypto voter is already a force to be

reckoned with, but it will continue to grow.

We're going to keep showing up

to protect our customer rights.

And help get sensible legislation passed

in major markets around the world.

So I love this.

Brian is saying, hey, look, we're, we're taking

a lot of wins in Congress, right?

We're more members supporting crypto.

We got bipartisan support.

We got the anti crypto army

under Elizabeth Warren falling apart.

But even after the election, we're going to keep pushing

and we're going to expand to around the world.

This is beautiful.

Even the Crypto Council for Innovation

said they're expanding around the globe.

So crypto is here to stay, folks.

It's a massive force and I think the crypto

industry, recognizing how this worked in the United States,

they're going to take this model to other countries.

So, guys, I'm so bullish.

All the big pillars are aligning here, whether

it be tradfi, the politics side of it,

mass adoption, mainstream adoption and so forth.

All these things, things are coming to fruition here.

It's a beautiful thing to watch.

Now we got news here that Canary Funds, which

recently filed for an XRP and Litecoin spot etf,

has just filed for a Solana etf.

This makes the second Solana ETF

application in the market following Vanex.

But Vaneck had withdrew there.

So let's see if Vaneck is going to

throw theirs back in the ring here.

However, Solana does have a challenge because it's named

in certain lawsuits that it is a security.

Now, XRP was declared not a security

intrinsically even though there's still ongoing litigation

with Ripple and the sec.

But I think these guys are making the bet that

Gary Genser is gone and that even if Kamala Harris

wins, that there will be a change, that they're going

to kick out Genser and it's not going to be

as aggressive because look, I've told you guys what I've

learned In being in D.C.

it wasn't Biden who was anti crypto.

I keep telling you guys, it was Elizabeth

Warren and I've heard this from many people.

She made, she cut the deal with Biden to drop

out of the Democratic primary and that she would become

the financial overseer on the Democrat side and her people

would be positioned in different parts of the government.

That's why you see people at the

treasury, you see Gary Genser, the SEC

and other places have been attacking crypto.

It's Elizabeth Warren.

Now, obviously he agreed and signed off, but it

wasn't his agenda is what I'm trying to say.

It was Elizabeth Warren, guys.

She was the one leading it.

And now that whole thing is falling apart.

So I think these guys filing these things now,

they are putting, it's like a put option that

Genser is going to be out, right? But I love it.

They're calling his bluff.

So James Safford of Bloomberg reported on the news.

So let's see how this all plays out now.

Final news item here.

Those of you who are Cleveland Cavaliers

fans, NBA fans, well, they launch a

rewards program, guess on which blockchain Avalanche.

And it's great to see real world adoption like

this where NFTs, tokens and different points and things

like that are being issued on the blockchain, folks.

So this is really awesome.

And they highlighted here that there's going

to be digital badges which are going

to be minted on the Avalanche blockchain.

So this is what we want to

see, crypto blockchains being inserted into different

industries and aspects of life.

And obviously we're just at the start.

This thing is going to snowball.

It's going to be everywhere.

Movie tickets, music, concert tickets and all that, insurance

policies, the deed to your house, your vehicle titles,

all these things will be on the blockchain.

So it's great to see it

happening in different ways, folks.
