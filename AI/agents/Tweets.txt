The big secret Bitcoin maxis don't want you to know. Many ignore it and just get angry when altcoins pump 😂. They also talk about altcoin rug pulls when Bitcoin Whales dump on them in each bull market. 

Once I learned this I figured out how to make money in the market. I also pay attention to what Bitcoin and Altcoin whales are doing (onchain data) versus listening coin maxis and people who are not educated about markets.


Altcoins continue to lead in social mentions with #Tron $TRX in first position, $XRP in second, and $RSR at third.

No surprise for $TRX as it broke ATHs last night.

 is happy this morning.

Lot's of people are trying to short $XRP right now. Big accounts posting FUD and more. Dangerous move imo, trying to short in a bull market is high risk.

The cognitive dissonance is real. BTC maxis saying XRP is a rug pull when it has been in the top 10 for years and as if BTC whales don't dump at the blowoff top. But I guess this is how they cope when altcoins outperform Bitcoin.

Hey Thinkers 💡

Altcoin Season is Here: XRP Leads the Charge

The long-awaited altcoin season is upon us, and it’s kicking off in spectacular fashion with XRP’s parabolic rise to $2.80. This massive pump signals a wave of retail interest returning to the market. Popular accounts like WallStreetBets and AshCrypto are fueling excitement by highlighting not just XRP but other altcoins such as Cardano.


Even if XRP isn’t in your portfolio, its rally should excite every crypto investor—it’s drawing much-needed attention and liquidity into the market. With Bitcoin cooling off and consolidating near the $100K mark, liquidity is flowing into altcoins like XLM, HBAR, and Chainlink, showcasing textbook bull market behavior.

📈 Why is XRP Pumping?
XRP’s explosive rally is more than just a technical move—it’s a contrarian pump that defies years of negativity, regulatory hurdles, and suppression. Let’s break down the key reasons behind this surge:

1️⃣ Price Suppression Lifted
The SEC lawsuit in 2020 derailed XRP’s previous bull run, leading to exchange delistings and FUD. However, Ripple’s legal victory earlier this year, where XRP was declared not a security, changed the game.

The re-listing of XRP across major exchanges and the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, coupled with President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, have turned the tides for XRP.

2️⃣ Institutional Demand on the Rise
Institutional interest is growing, led by Grayscale’s relaunch of the XRP Trust and several XRP Spot ETF filings by major players like WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Funds.

Just yesterday, XRP surged past Solana and Tether (USDT) to claim the #3 spot by market capitalization.

3️⃣ XRP Ledger (XRPL) Growth
On-chain activity on XRPL is ramping up, including the emergence of memecoins and the upcoming launch of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, pending approval from NYDFS.

XRP’s rally demonstrates its resilience against regulatory suppression and FUD, marking a pivotal moment in the crypto market.

💰 Will Bitcoin Hit $100K+ This Month?
Despite a slight pullback near the $100K mark, Bitcoin is showing strong signs of continuation towards $120K this month:

Whale Accumulation: The number of wallets holding 10+ BTC is steadily rising.


Exchange Supply Decline: Bitcoin supply on exchanges is at historic lows, signaling reduced selling pressure.


The Bitcoin Pi Cycle Top Indicator is not flashing


The data suggests Bitcoin’s current consolidation is merely a breather before the next leg up, with whales and institutions accumulating aggressively.

My $XRP price target for this cycle $5-$8. It could go a bit higher but I'm gonna play it safe and be conservative. People who are calling for $589, $1,000, and $10K are smoking crack.
