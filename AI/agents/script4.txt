Bitcoin has pulled back to $68,000. What's happening?

Where is this bull market?

Is it the election uncertainty

that's causing all these problems?

I'll share my thoughts, the charts and

what other expert analysts are saying.

Let's get into it.

Hey everybody.

Welcome into the Thinking Crypto podcast, your

Folks, let's talk about Bitcoin.

Because it pulled back significantly,

it went below $68,000.

However, when you look at the daily chart, we

are still seeing higher highs and higher lows.

However, this low that it put in is dangerously

close to the higher low that was set before.

It hasn't broken it and it hasn't been invalidated yet.

But we have to make sure that we are

looking at both the bullish and the bearish scenario.

Now, I personally believe, based on chart movements, based

on what's happening with the DXY breaking down as

well, that Bitcoin will continue to move upwards.

But I'm also prepared for if this gets invalidated and

then we have to go back to the drawing board.

Now, from a macro standpoint, when we're looking at

the, let's say six month or yearly perspective, we

are still on track in this bull market.

There hasn't been any major invalidation.

And as we've been seeing, Bitcoin has been crawling its way

out of this accumulation zone and it of course last week

touched 73,000 dol and that's a very good sign.

So it's knocking at the door to break

out of that all time high set earlier

this year and then enter into price discovery.

Now, of course we can't really look at

altcoins, we have to look at Bitcoin.

It's the measuring stick that we have to

use because the liquidity generally enters bitcoin and

then it flows down to the altcoins.

That's not to say liquidity can come in

directly to some altcoins, we've seen that, like

Solana and Sui and so forth.

But generally for the entire crypto market to

move, we need Bitcoin to have that strength

and to bring in a ton of liquidity.

So we have to pay attention closely to the charts

over the next week or so because the election, as

I've Been telling you guys is causing a lot of

uncertainty and you're going to see a lot of volatility.

And this is true for all markets.

It's not just true for crypto.

So once the election's out of the way,

we're going to see less volatility in the

market and people can start focusing on markets

versus politics in the election and so forth.

Here's what different analysts are saying.

One analyst said the following. Don't panic.

This can be nothing but a casual bullish

retest of its 230 days diagonal resistance.

Speaking of bitcoin, and if you look at the

chart here that they provided, you can see it

is within the trend lines and the structure here.

So the analyst said if this

holds, we can get continuation.

If it fails, 64k and 60k are next.

He says, personally, I bet on bullish continuation.

I'm of the same mindset, not because I'm

biased, but because of the technicals in the

charts and what the macro is doing and

what we've seen historically from a seasonal standpoint.

But once again there is a bearish case that if

this fails, it could trigger a series of other events

and we have to go back to the drawing board.

So we want to keep it balanced.

Now, even before Bitcoin broke down here, Crypto wizard had

shared a chart on October 29th highlighting that this was

going to be a normal move for bitcoin.

It would pull back to about 68k because

it made a huge move up to 73k.

And he had said at that point the descending channel

in bitcoin has been broken out after eight months.

A breakout above 72K opens the door to

a new all time high to 82K.

And he highlighted here a retest of that support level.

So this was something that was not off

the table or out of the conversation here.

It was a possible scenario, it

didn't mean it had to happen.

But we're talking probabilities here.

Now Crypto wizard also shared a macro chart

here, zooming out, showing the different market cycles

and their relation to the elections.

So showing where we're at here for the 2024

election, showing where we're at we were at in

2020 for that election, in 2016 as well.

And you can see bitcoin had not really put in any

major gains, mostly retracing to its prior all time highs.

That's pretty much where we're at.

So we need this election out of the way.

I know I keep repeating myself, but we've

seen this before, this is not unusual.

And the only thing that's a little bit different

is that bitcoin hit a new all time high

before the having at the beginning of this year.

So it put us ahead of schedule.

But this slowdown and boring zone and accumulation

zone is putting us back on track.

So once again, no major

invalidation of the bull market.

I'm here to make money, so I

don't have time to play games.

I don't, I'm not here to lie to you

guys, to get views or whatever it is.

I want bitcoin to go to 150k and

that will be game changing not only because

I hold bitcoin, but for all coins.

So I'm in the same boat as you guys.

I know it can be frustrating, I know it can be painful.

But this is where patience

is so important in investing.

Now, Jason Pizzino, who's a great analyst,

guys, I highly recommend you follow him.

He's on Twitter, but He's also on YouTube.

I listen to a lot of his content.

He said the U.S.

election 2024 update.

It doesn't look like this U.S.

election will be a clear Trump win, which

the markets, US Stock markets and bitcoin have

been preparing for over the last week.

Or we know this election's been quite tight, guys.

Some of the polling and so forth show this.

Now I'm going to get a lot of comments.

People are going to say, you are an idiot.

Trump is clearly winning, right?

People are in their own bubbles and they only

want to hear things that validate their bias.

The point is, until election day, the results are

in, we don't know, it is not that clear.

It's very tight.

And I'm not saying Harris is

going to win, maybe Trump wins.

But the point is we don't know and we have to

wait for the results and we're not here to invest with

our emotions and get emotional and worked up and triggered.

Let's look at the data and

let's look at what's happening.

So Jason continues, he says if Harris wins,

the markets will likely freak out in the

direction of the current trend down.

However, they'll eventually realize that the

massive amount of stimulus money coming

will pump the markets once again.

And this here, folks, what Jason is saying

is the macro factors, people get so caught

up in narratives and so forth.

But at the end of the day,

bitcoin is not correlated to Trump, Bitcoin

is not correlated to Republican or Democrat.

Bitcoin has pumped under Obama, Trump, Biden, so on and

so Forth, it doesn't care who the President is.

What it's correlated to is global liquidity

and the money printer folks, right?

The money printer feeds global liquidity,

the fiat system we live in.

They will go back to printing money.

I've been telling you guys for a year now.

They cut rates, they go back to qe. It's a process.

It doesn't happen overnight.

And that's what drives markets.

Yes, there are other factors that drive the valuation

and demand for stocks and different things because companies

have great earnings, new technology, yada yada.

But at the end of the day, the main

factor is the denominator, the US Dollar, which they

continue to debase and continue to print more of.

And guess what they're going to continue doing, folks, as

they cut rates and keep raising the debt ceiling.

Print money.

So Jason is saying in the short term you

may see some downside pressure because there's this narrative

out there that Trump is going to be better

for bitcoin and crypto and so forth.

But at the end of the day, bitcoin

and crypto will continue to move because it

is correlated to the money printing.

So watch the M2 money supply from the Fed.

Watch global liquidity.

That's what I'm looking at.

Now, as I've said many times, Trump would, I think,

be better for crypto businesses from a clarity standpoint.

But asset prices are not, not dependent on Trump.

So if you are running with

that narrative, you're missing the mark.

You're not looking at data, you're looking

at your feelings, your emotions, your bias,

your political bias and so forth.

And both Democrats and Republicans print money.

That's this fiat system we live in.

So Jason continues saying, so expect volatility

while swings with upside to resume.

He says if Harris wins, dump a little range, then pump.

If Trump wins, probably pump, then pump more.

Both are still bullish, medium to long term, both have the

same end game, just a different path to get there.

So this is what people who study data and

analytics and stats are looking at, not their emotions,

but what the correlation is for these asset prices.

He says, overall my analysis has not

indicated any change in the cycle.

Therefore I expect higher prices with more volatility as it

is the winner's curse phase of the 18 year cycle.

Something I've been covering for many months now.

Now be sure to check out his, his channel, guys.

He covers a lot of stuff.

And once again, this is not emotional, this

is not politics, this is markets and liquidity

and what the Fed is doing and what

other central banks around the world are doing.

So please understand me.

I'm not trying to say don't go vote for

the candidate you love or you want to vote

for, because there's many other issues to vote on.

But when it comes to things like asset prices

and markets, there are true fundamentals that you need

to pay attention to and understand how they work.

So I'm in full agreement with what Jason's saying here.

Now guys, quick word from our

sponsor and that is Vechain.

Vechain is one of the top

layer one smart contract platforms.

They're working with many enterprises around

the world to build Web3 technologies.

Some of the great attributes of

the Vechain blockchain includes it's secure,

affordable, scalable, fast and sustainable.

And they work with big brands like Givenchy, PwC,

Boston Consulting Group, BMW, Walmart, China and much more.

I've been a vet token holder for many

years, so I'm very bullish on this project. If.

If you'd like to learn more about vechain,

go to vechain.org now on the topic of

politics, Vivek Ramaswamy's Strive launches a wealth management

arm to bring Bitcoin to standard portfolios.

Now we know Vivek understands crypto, we know

Trump is pro crypto and much more.

JD Vance and all these guys understand it.

We're seeing a lot of tradfi folks are

now launching an arm to invest in crypto

building with crypto and much more.

So Strive Enterprises, an asset manager co

founded by former presidential candidate and current

Trump surrogate Vivek Ramaswamy, announced the creation

of its wealth management business.

The business aims to integrate Bitcoin into

standard portfolios of everyday Americans and launches

amid a corporate move and the closure

of a $30 million investment round.

Everybody's coming for crypto, they want it

and they're creating financial products, they're building

with it and much more.

It's pretty incredible.

Now check this out.

US government seeks to return $13 million

in political donations from former FTX executives.

This is interesting.

The US government has been given more time

to negotiate with certain political action groups over

the return of up to $13.25 million in

donations made in the names of former FTX

executive Sam Bankman Fried and Nishad Singh.

A recent filing shows the political groups in

question are mostly Democrat aligned and include Senate

Majority pac, Emily's Lists, Slash Women Vote and

the Future Forward pack which received $6 million.

Singh was recently sentenced to time serve and

three years of supervised release, allowing the former

FTX engineering director to avoid prison time.

So we're seeing some claw back

here of those political donations.

And this was a topic I remember speaking to Anthony

Scaramucci about when I did an interview with him.

And it's fascinating.

Let's see how much more they pull back.

And remember, Maxine Waters was hugging up sbf,

blowing him kisses and stuff like that, because

he was doing big donations to the Democrats.

Now, don't get me wrong, he also

donated to Republicans, but a majority of

his donations were to the Democrats.

And that's probably because, you know, Biden and the

Democrats were in office around the time of when

he was making his rounds in Washington, D.C.

but of course, he was committing epic

fraud, stealing people's funds and much more.

And he was meeting with the SEC and Gary Genser

and they did nothing to stop all this nonsense.

But thank goodness we're seeing some resolution here.

The bankruptcy proceedings are happening where

people will get back some money.

And SBF is in jail.

All of his partners in crime, Caroline,

and all these folks in jail.

So the nature is healing, folks.

Now, apparently there were some rumors that

Tether was launching its own blockchain.

And Tether CEO Paulo Arduino cleared up the rumor, saying,

I hear again few rumors about a Tether chain.

Tether is not planning to build

an official blockchain at this time.

Simply different, independent, dependent L2 solutions are

working to support USDT for gas fees.

So I don't know who started the rumor, but

they're trying to say Tether was going to launch

its own blockchain or whatever it is, but they

said clearly they're not doing that.

So that's the news, folks.

Let me know what you think about the election

and the markets and what's happening with Bitcoin.

I think expect a lot of volatility as we

head into tomorrow, Monday and of course, Tuesday.

And look, it's kind of like the Fed meeting weeks,

where you have a ton of volatility that we could

probably see a lot of that this week.

So you kind of have to let the

dust settle and go into the following week.

I've seen that historically with markets, you

can't judge it this the week after.

Just there's just so much going on.

So just be mentally prepared that you're

going to probably see some wild swings.

Maybe, you know, maybe I don't want

to say that's a guarantee, but be

mentally prepared as an informed, educated investor.

Right?

You want to be prepared for all these

things so you're not rocking in the sea

of volatility, like a ship without an anchor.

So I hope you guys understand what I'm saying

here and I'm saying this from experience because I've

been through all of that and I had to

learn my lessons and not be not moved by

my emotions and what the markets are doing.

But look at the macro, look at the charts, look at

the technicals and what story and even on chain data that

we have in crypto, what story is that telling me?
