Why isn't bitcoin pumping?

That's the big question everyone has.

Well, I have some answers for you guys as

the charts are lining up and it shows.

We are on the cusp of a massive

bull run again and the US government recovers

some crypto that was stolen from them.

I'll give you the details there.

And there's some big updates around

Ethereum and Coinbase's base layer two.

Let's get into it.

Hey everybody.

Folks, what the hell is happening with bitcoin?

I want to share some thoughts here because bitcoin, of

course, is the mover of the entire crypto market.

It brings in the liquidity so the altcoins can move.

So we need bitcoin to do something.

And bitcoin has been trying to break out and

bust through $70,000, but it keeps hitting a ceiling.

So what is holding it back?

And over this weekend I put together a

newsletter about this topic and I want to

share what some other analysts are saying.

But the main catalyst, folks, for what's holding bitcoin

back is the dxy, the dollar currency index.

We know there's an inverse correlation and if you look

at the dollar currency index going back to September into

the whole of October, it's been going parabolic.

Look at the daily chart.

Green candle after green candle.

This is what we wanted bitcoin to do.

But unfortunately the DXY is doing it.

And if you recall, I was telling you guys

that early in September, I thought the DXY would

find some short term strength before rolling over.

Well, it found more than short term strength.

It's been going nuts.

But the silver lining here, guys, is that

it is extremely overbought by the textbook.

You look at the Daily RSI, it's above 70.

It's been hanging out around the

top here for a long time.

It just refuses to break down.

But one thing's for sure, let's

put our emotions to the side.

This is not sustainable.

You look at any asset or

currency, you look at these charts.

When it's in the overbought zone,

it can't stay there forever.

It's going to break down.

And the longer it stays up

there, the stronger that breakdown is. Going to be.

So I'm preparing for once the election and some of

these macro factors come into alignment, you're going to see

the DXY break down significantly and that's going to be

very bullish for bitcoin and the altcoins.

I believe bitcoin is going to start

to go parabolic in November into December.

Now, I could be wrong.

I don't have a crystal ball, but I'm forming

my thesis on the data, not my feelings or

emotions, what the data is telling us.

And bitcoin one, one thing that's very bullish

is on the short term timeframe, it is

forming higher highs and lower highs.

That's a good sign.

It's stair stepping its way out of this

zone now it has to break 270.

That's key, right?

So I think 70k is around the corner

where we can break through there and then

it's going to go into price Discover.

That's what we're waiting for, folks.

And I know it's painstaking, I know it's annoying.

Look, I've been here from multiple

bull and bear market cycles.

This is boring the hell out of me.

Now I'm not fearful, I'm just bored.

I'm just like, oh come on, like we want

to get this show in the road, right?

I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm

not fearful because I see different factors.

The macro, the technicals and much more

are aligning with the bull run continuing.

But it's a patience game.

It is so much of a patience game.

And this is where smart money

is usually able to outlast retail.

And people who are not financially educated, right?

People who are not financially educated follow headlines and then

they sell, they dump, they run for the hills when

they see the price pull back and there's some negative

news versus saying, hey, I'm gonna buy the dip and

continue to add my position because I know where we're

at in the timeline of this bull market.

And unfortunately, unless you're financially educated, doing your

research, listening to the thinking crypto podcast and

getting up to date information, look, other podcasts

as well who are sharing quality information.

You're like a plastic bag floating in the wind, right?

You need to be anchored and understand the data.

The data is so important and

understanding what's happening in the markets.

So let me share what

some different analysts are saying.

So analyst Bob Lucas, who I'm a big fan of, he

says Bitcoin on day 51 of 60 day average cycle and

not breaking down near its high this is a right translated

cycle indicating consolidation since March is coming to an end.

Bullish structural change without confirmation due

for a dip into November 5th.

But there's never a guarantee.

Okay, couple things to unpack there.

Right translated cycle means it's the

extended cycle he was predicting.

Possibly, possibly he was just throwing a thesis out there that

it would be a left translated cycle and we would have

to blow off top by the end of this year.

But unfortunately bitcoin said no, we're going to stick

to the plan of the normal four year cycle.

And the reason why Bob and other people are

saying left translated cycle is because bitcoin was ahead

of schedule at the beginning of this year.

It hit the new all time high before the having.

It never did that in its history and

the ETF buying was driving so much demand.

But I think it's good that bitcoin is slowing down and

we're back to a normal cycle pacing and that will be

good because it allows it to build more momentum and for

more liquidity and all these things to come into play.

And it aligns with the rise of global liquidity,

the continuation of money printing and all these things.

So Bob continues saying, basically given where the four

year cycle stands about to begin, year three, an

eight month range, we're on the cusp of a

breakout and resumption of the bull trend.

So I'm in agreement with Bob.

He shared different scenarios as far as the timeline.

So one, the first scenario he shared is

where the breakout comes in November post election.

The other is, the other two is more of

a pullback into November, but then a bounce in

November as well and then the continuation, then the

one where it's really extended, where it just goes

sideways till like December and then breaks out.

My hope is, you know, at least the middle

number two option versus that long extended one.

But it is what it is.

We have to be patient, right?

If we want to make good returns, good make

money in this market, we have to be patient.

That's the one thing we can control, our patience.

We can't control what the market

does because there's different factors.

But we can have an idea of where we're headed

based on charts and technicals and macro, not our feelings.

And be patient, that's the key.

So I hope you guys understand what I'm saying.

Crypto wizard said the Q4 bull.

The fun is already starting.

Bitcoin has started Q4 with a bullish impulse.

The parabolic move is coming.

It's only a matter of time.

Patience pays.

So Once again, higher highs, higher lows.

That's a very good sign versus what was

happening, you know, from March down right, we

were forming these lower highs and lower lows.

So I think we found the bottom.

But it's going to be a bit of

a slow stair step out of this scenario.

So guys, things are aligning and as I

wrote in my newsletter, as that DXY starts

breaking down and we head into more risk

on environment, the money printing from these governments

continue and we've seen the historical correlation, inverse

correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin.

So the DXY is the main catalyst and I

think the uncertainty of the election getting out of

the way will be very bullish for risk assets.

And in addition to global liquidity

continuing to rise and much more.

So the on chain metrics also

show that whales are bullish.

So bitcoin supply and exchanges continues to drop.

That's usually an indicator that you see throughout

the bull market cycle when there's a lot

of bitcoin head to the exchanges.

That means people are going to start

selling, start dumping when it's coming off.

It means there's no cell pressure or

less sell pressure I should say.

And whales and sharks with 10 plus Bitcoin in

their wallets continues to, they continue to accumulate.

So that number is rising and that's a very good sign.

Now quick word from our sponsor and that is Bitgo.

Bitgo is one of the top

tier crypto custodians in the industry.

They provide wallet services and much more.

Bitgo is headed up by Mike Belshi

Who's a Web 1.0 and 2.0 legend.

Many big brands and companies work with Bitgo.

Bitstamp Exchange uses BitGo Sui Pantera

Capital, that's Dan Morehead, 21 shares.

So BitGo helps to custody some of

the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF assets.

So they have a lot of great solutions.

And folks, even Nike uses Bitgo's wallet services for

the NFTs and they have a self hosted wallet

for retail that you can leverage, guys.

So Bitgo once again one of the

most trusted custodians in the industry.

They've been through multiple bull and bear market cycles and

they are still here and they continue to build.

So if you'd like to learn more about bitgo

go to bitgo.com link will be in the description.

Now folks, check this news out.

The United States government has retrieved over $19

million from a purported hack this week.

And this is according to Arkham and

Zach xbt, who's an Amazing sleuth.

So the government linked wallet has seemingly

recovered 88% of the lost funds within

the day of the security incident.

The wallet linked to the US government lost over $20

million worth of stablecoins in E on October 24th.

So this is interesting.

The funds included $14 million in the AusDC stablecoin.

I've never heard that stablecoin, $5.4 million in USDC

and $1.1 million in USDT and $500,000 in ETH.

So this is interesting.

I wonder who was hacking the hell out of them.

Though it's unclear at the time why the

funds move both Arkham and Cryp Zach XBTC

noted that the funds movement suggested malicious activity.

The perpetrator moved the funds to non

custodial applications in what appeared to be

an attempt to launder the stolen cryptocurrency.

The funds themselves hadn't been moved in

over eight months before October 24th.

So who the hell would try to

hack a government wallet Crypto wallet?

I don't know, but that's a pretty dumb move because

you're going to have a target on your back.

They're going to come after you, right?

So pretty interesting news.

There's now Vitalik Buterin outlines ways to

reduce Ethereum's bloat in Purge Upgrade Roadmap.

So reducing the need for every node to

permanently store all history in addition to unneeded

protocol features could mitigate Ethereum's bloat, Buterin said.

Titled the Purge, the Possible Roadmap

is Buterin's fifth installment in a

series of contemplating Ethereum's future.

Now Ethereum, it's been getting incredible adoption, but

also there's a ton of layer twos on

it because it has scalability issues and it

had the first mover advantage with smart contracts.

So I think that's why it has a lot of adoption.

But over time, if it's not able to fix some

of these issues and improve them, other layer 1 smart

contract platforms are going to come steal market share.

And look at the end of the day, I've said it

many times, it's going to be a multi chain world.

There's not going to be one

blockchain to rule them all, right?

And we're going to see competitors like Look,

Solana, Avalanche, Sui, Aptos and so forth.

These are going to come take market share.

Now, as always, we don't know the future and

we'll have to see which ones survive, right?

Because not everything's going to survive, folks.

We've Seen this in many different industries, whether

it was Web 1.0 with the dot com

boom and different websites and Services, Web 2.0

with Social Networks and apps and so forth.

Not everything survives.

And there's going to possibly be just a handful of winners

who are going to at least, least for, for the smart

contracts now who are going to be in the market.

It's not going to be a thousand smart contract

block blockchains are going to be in the market.

That is possible, but not highly probable, right?

Based on the history of adoption

of technology and so forth.

But let's see what Buterin is able to come up with.

Let's move ahead.

Base, which is the layer 2 on

Ethereum, which was created by Coinbase.

It's one day stablecoin transfer volume outranks

all other chains for the first time.

Boy, Coinbase made a smart move when they built this

thing and they didn't put a token on it.

And they're collecting fees,

it's boosting their revenue.

It's, it's been getting a lot of adoption.

So this is really amazing.

So the volume of stable coins transferred on Coinbase's

base Ethereum layer 2 blockchain on October 26 was

higher than all other blockchains for the first time.

Artemis data shows 30% of all stable coin

volume took place on base, a higher proportion

than typical leaders Ethereum, Salon and Tron.

Now, we know Coinbase, they leverage a lot

of USD, so that's really beneficial for them.

They're a big pusher of USDC

and nothing wrong with that.

I, I like usdc.

It works really great.

And I've had Jeremy Lair on the

podcast talking about USDC and much more.

So it makes sense that they're seeing

this type of activity and they also

support USDT and, and other stable coins.

So makes sense.

Smart move by Coinbase.

And that's why this week we saw crack

in exchange that, hey, we're going to launch

our own blockchain as well called inc.

And I believe they're doing that on optimism, which

is another layer two on top of Ethereum.

So Coinbase really set the standard here.

Now, I know Binance was the first to

create this idea with Binance smart chain, but

Coinbase took it to another level.

I mean, we have to be realistic.

The amount of building that's taking

place and how they monetize it.

And being smart by not, you know, creating

a token with it, I think really has

really worked out well for them.

Now, continuing the news around Coinbase.

Guys, I'm really excited about this news and

I'm actually going to be testing this out.

So Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, tweeted out create

an AI agent with a crypto wallet and optional

X account in less than three minutes.

Folks, we heard a bit about this

about a month ago where Coinbase tested

the first payment transfer between AI agents.

Well, they've now built the ability for

you to create an AI agent.

I think this is going to be really game changing

in for many different industries that you can have this

automated AI agent going out doing things and the creator

of it doesn't have to be constantly monitoring it.

It has a wallet, you can pay

it, you can do stuff with it.

So I don't know, maybe like someone creates an AI

agent that answers questions about a certain topic on social

media or X or something like that and you can

tip it or pay it for the answer.

You see where I'm going with this, right?

There's a lot of things that could be automated and people

can earn and it doesn't have to be something crazy.

Maybe you tip it a couple bucks in usdc, I don't know.

Or pay it a couple bucks in usdc.

Hope you guys see what I'm talking about. This is big.

And this is why I've often said that AI

and blockchain are going to have a symbiotic relationship.

They're going to benefit each other because AI is

going to help enhance blockchain and Web three attributes

and increase the automation, while blockchain is going to

be used to police AI, to make sure that

these deep fakes and all these things don't get

out of hand and we can verify things.

So pretty amazing stuff, right folks?

I'm really excited to see what, what else

is going to be generated out of this.

So I'm actually going to be researching this.

How can I leverage this to benefit you guys,

you know, whatever it may be and create new

services and products and things like that.

It's pretty, pretty amazing stuff.
