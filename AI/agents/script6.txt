I've got breaking news for you.

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the DOJ

is investigating Tether, possibly looking to sanction them.

However, Tether's CEO comes out saying that's false.

I'll share the details with you.

And the first university has disclosed that

it has invested in Bitcoin ETFs.

As a former SEC enforcement director comes

out criticizing Gary Genser and the SEC.

Let's get into it.

Hey everybody, welcome into the Thinking Crypto podcast,

Folks, let's quickly look at the DXY and bitcoin.

Bitcoin right now back down to 66.

It was making some moves earlier this week

as well as earlier today, but it's not

able to break through just as yet.

And the reason is the DXY which

is at the cusp of breaking down.

It is super overbought on the daily rsi, but it just

keeps lingering up there and it's going to break down.

Guys, I know I keep telling you, but

this is where we have to be patient.

We don't control these things, but we can look

at the charts and the fundamentals and the macro

and so forth and form our thesis and then

be patient to let that thesis play out.

So waiting for this thing to break down and this

will be the trigger I think to help bitcoin blast

through 70k and then move to new all time highs.

So right now we are still in a waiting pattern.

I know a lot of analysts have been

saying hey, this thing's about to move significantly

and so on and so forth.

But just give it, I think another few

weeks and this thing will start breaking down.

Especially with the US elections out of the

way and that uncertainty out of the way.

That should definitely help one thing that's for sure.

The big players continue to buy Bitcoin.

Here we got reports that Black BlackRock's ETF inflows

just yesterday was over $165 million and today it

was reported that Fidelity bought 852 Bitcoin.

So they continue to accumulate folks.

And it makes sense.

Smart money is going to buy to dips, buy

to fear, buy the sideways chop where retail is

bored, retail is scared, retail is like I'm done.

The bull market's Over. I'm out of here.

But smart money knows what's coming.

They know global liquidity is on the rise.

The money printed will be started up

back here in the United States.

And as the debasement of currency takes place in

the US and globally, asset prices will rise.

So this is a very positive

sign that they continue to buy.

And here, guys, we got a report, and

this is from an SEC filing that the

first university to report publicly about their Bitcoin

ETF ownership, this is Emory University.

They filed their 13F.

They own $15 million of Bitcoin or

Grayscale's Bitcoin minitrust as of September 30th.

Matthew Siegel of Vane said, while many universities

hold Bitcoin indirectly through funds or have accepted

Bitcoin donations, Emory's position in a Bitcoin ETF

is a first in higher education.

So one of the great benefits of the ETFs,

it opens up the door for many different endowments,

universities and different companies to access the asset class

safely and without having to worry about regulatory issues.

You know, if they were to hold Bitcoin directly on

their balance sheet, you know, that may cause some issues.

But if they hold it via an ETF, which

is some BlackRock for fidelity and so forth, it

makes it very safe for them to do that.

It's less risky.

And obviously the ETF wrappers provide a whole bunch

of different benefits and insurance and all these things.

Right?

So I think we're going to continue to

see more of this as well as companies

adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet.

Yesterday we talked about Microsoft and

them looking to do that.

And of course, Microsoft shareholders are going

to vote on that come December 10th.

So it's going to be a very interesting December, folks.

Now check this out, guys.

The New York Stock Exchange is looking to

extend trading to 22 hours a day, opening

at 1:30am and closing at 11:30pm Eastern.

So you may say what?

Why are they looking to do this? Right.

Well, it's what the story I've

been telling you guys for years.

The crypto market is 24 7.

No holidays, no opening and closing

bell, no weekends and so forth.

And when you put traditional assets on the

blockchain, it's going to further increase trading activity.

Well, they're essentially trying to catch

up to what's happening in crypto.

That's the only true global market.

And, and it's amazing to see

them capitulate in this way.

And obviously it's not fully 24 hours and it's not

on weekends, but they're extending it during the weekday.

So very interesting. What's happening guys?

This is because of crypto, because they realize

that people are trading crypto globally 24,7.

It doesn't close, it doesn't stop.

And eventually all the stuff listed on the New York

Stock Exchange is going to go on the blockchain.

You're going to have fractionalization like I've

been saying, 24,7 trading truly global market.

So pretty incredible.

What's happening now?

Quick word from our sponsor and that is Vechain.

Vechain is one of the

top layer one enterprise blockchains.

Many big brands leverage VeChain to

build Web3 and decentralized applications.

I'm a vet token holder, I have been for years.

So I'm bullish on this project.

I believe it will do well in this bull market cycle.

Some of the benefits of the

Vechain blockchain include it is secure,

affordable, scalable, fast and sustainable.

Some of the companies that are working

with vechain include Givenchy, BMW, Walmart China,

Boston Consulting Group, PwC and many more.

So if you'd like to learn more about vechain,

go to vechain.org link will be in the description.

Now guys, this afternoon the Wall Street

Journal broke the news that federal investigators

are probing the cryptocurrency firm Tether.

Authorities are looking at possible violations of

anti money laundering and sanction rules.

So the Wall Street Journal has a paywall up here.

So I can give you all the details.

Let me read what I can see here.

The criminal investigation run by the Manhattan U.

S Attorney's office is looking at whether the

cryptocurrency has been used by third for, you

know, bad activities and so forth.

Now Tether CEO Paulo Arduino, and if you guys recall,

I had him on the podcast earlier this year.

He says, as we told the Wall Street Journal,

there is no indication that Tether is under investigation.

Wall Street Journal is regurgitating

old noise, full stop.

He also added, at Tether, we deal regularly and

directly with law enforcement officials to help prevent rogue

nations, terrorists and criminals from misusing usdt.

We would know if we are being

investigated as the article falsely claimed.

Based on that, we can confirm that the

allegations in the article are unequivocally false.

Okay folks, there's a lot of layers

to peel back from this onion.

I've often stated on the podcast in full transparency with you

guys that I believe in the early days, Tether's ship was

not in order, their house was not in order.

I don't think they were fully reserved back in the day.

And I've interviewed multiple co founders

of Tether, Brock Pierce, and there's

another gentleman, I forgot his name.

I think actually three, three

co founders I've interviewed.

Paulo is the CEO and I interviewed him earlier

this year and even he stated that back in

the day things were not in the right place.

They didn't do a good job in transparency and so forth.

Now they do quarterly attestations.

Cancer Fitzgerald, which is a legacy Wall street firm which

is headed up by Howard Lutnick, has said they have

the reserves and their books are in order.

Howard Lutnick, as you guys know,

was at the bitcoin conference.

He supports Donald Trump and so forth.

So you have some credible people

saying their books are in order.

So what's happening here?

Why are we seeing this continued campaign

trying to expose Tether and all that? Right?

There was even, I think a couple months

ago or during the summer they put this

big ad campaign trying to expose Tether.

They did, you know, big billboard ads down in

Times Square, New York City and so forth.

And I'll was like that, that just looks really weird.

If you have actual information, go to

the doj, go to the law enforcement.

Why are you trying to do some sort of smear campaign?

That's how it came off as and a factor

here that we have to keep in mind.

Tether's king of the hill.

So there's going to be competitors attacking them.

And I'm not saying that's wrong.

That's the art of war, that's business, right?

If you see a weakness in your

competition, you try to expose that.

I'm about the free market now.

I don't believe in breaking the law to

try to take down your competitors and lying.

But if you see there's some ambiguity and

so forth, you try to expose that.

So I think there's a bit of that.

These campaigns, these FUD that comes out

every quarter, every month, whatever it is.

I've seen it since I've been here

in the crypto industry since 2016.

So when I see stuff like this, I don't have

a hidden agenda trying to promote tether or trying to

hide things that are bad that tether is doing.

I call it like I see it.

But we also have to keep things real, right?

Competitors are going to try to go

after Tether to take them down.

The other aspect, and I saw someone tweet about

this, this type of news and so forth is

about Tether being more transparent with Kyc and aml.

It's the Binance situation.

Notice Binance didn't go out of business.

CZ had to step away.

They had to pay a big fine and

then come in line with the regulations.

I believe that's what's going to happen with Tether.

Tether is not going anywhere.

They have the largest stable coin and by market share,

and the majority of that is outside the United States.

I think what's going to have to happen, they're going

to have to strictly adhere to KYC and AML laws

or they're going to get banned in the United States.

I do think they're trying to

work through some of these things.

And as Paolo says, this report is false.

But I think this type of news and this

type of dark cloud is going to hang over

them until the KYC AML part is fully resolved. I don't.

We.

We don't have all the details, of course, so

I think that's what's going on here, folks.

So let's recap.

One bad reputation from the early days,

continuing to follow them, competitors taking shots.

That's the free market.

And third, the US Government and some of these big

jurisdictions want Tether to be fully in line with these

laws, a la Binan, even though it's a different business.

You know, they're not in.

Tether's not an exchange.

But the whole thing is kyc, aml.

Remember, that's what Binance got hit with, not fraud.

Not, not that they were stealing

customer funds like Sam Bankman Freed.

But hey, you guys were not doing KYC, AML, here's

a $4 billion fine and CZ, get the hell out. Right?

So I think eventually Tether will come into

line with whatever they need to do.

But be careful when you see stuff like

this, because if the DOJ actually had information,

I think they would have already taken action. Right?

Let's be real.

I mean, if you went after Binance and

you got, you know, whatever it is they

tether, they would have gone after each other.

So let's see what comes out.

Once again, I'm not saying they're

perfect or they're doing everything right.

I only know from my own research and people

I've interviewed and people I've spoken to and haven't

been in the market for a long time.

So I have to keep things balanced.

And I see it from a more of a 360 view.

I don't have an agenda to protect them.

I don't have agenda to try to take them down.

I'm Just a neutral party reporting news to you.

So that's what I think.

I'll try to get Paolo back on the podcast to ask

him about this stuff, like what's going on, what's going on

with kyc, aml, what's going on with all these things?

Do you think that's why they're.

You're getting targeted? Right.

So I'll keep it real with you guys.

And one other factor, you know, and it's not so much

the competitor bucket item that I mentioned to you guys, but

there are people looking to short Bitcoin or short the crypto

industry and a great way that they do these things to

drive fear and cell pressure plant articles. Right.

Once again, if the DOJ has facts and

they have stuff against tether, take action.

I want to hear from the doj.

I don't want to hear sources tell us. Right.

Who's your sources?

The guy in the random guy in the street, the

short seller who paid you $50,000 for the article.

See what I mean, guys?

I've been around the block.

I know some of the things that these

guys do and planting articles and so forth.

So that's my 2 cents on it.

I would love to hear what you guys think. Of course.

Now check this out.

Former SEC enforcement lawyer Leighton Stewart talks about

her experience being on both sides of the

battle between the agency and the crypto industry.

So she spoke at Crypto Investor Day, which

took place in New York City today.

I didn't get to attend that, but here's a quote.

When you come to this side and you realize that

there are people who really want to find a way

to work with regulators, and they feel like that's just

not possible given, you know, who is at the helm

of the SEC or generally the Biden administration.

And it gets in the way of any effort

toward reaching some regulatory clarity or anything that allows

us to work toward building this industry.

Anthony Popliano asks Nelson Mullen's lawyer, Richard Levin,

what do you think the most impactful change

could be that would unleash innovation, adoption, growth,

etc in America for crypto?

Levin said, I would push the SEC to

actually comply with the Administrative Procedure Act.

Wow.

So it's funny, when these people leave the sec,

then they are able to speak freely, obviously, and

they, they all come out against the sec.

It's, it's incredible.

And this is why it goes back to what I've been saying.

The phone call was made to Gary

Genser and he's, he's running the sec.

So even if These people don't

agree what, what Gensler is doing.

They can't do anything because

Genser, he's the chair, right?

And we know he's a scumbag regular

and what he's been up to.

So even people that have worked and under

him are leaving and coming out and saying

different things contrary to what he's been doing.

It's incredible.

But this is where change is coming.

The election and much more. And in the courts.

The crypto industry is fighting

back and getting victories now.

Final news item here. Flare.

Many of you know Flare networks.

I hold a flare token.

I currently delegate and continue to earn rewards.

Well, they highlighted something today

with their Google Cloud partnership.

They said introducing Flare's blockchain machine images on

Google Cloud Marketplace, enabling rapid deployment of full

nodes across 20 plus networks, including Bitcoin and

Ethereum, with plans to add more.

A scalable and reliable

solution designed for developers.

So this is really good.

And even if you don't hold a flare token,

you're like, hey, I don't care about this news.

What you should care about Google.

Google is involved in many different Web3 projects.

They're involved with Hedera.

They're a governing council member.

They're doing a lot, guys.

And it's great to see these big tech giants jumping in

and they have to because this is the future, folks.

So, so you're seeing more

validation of this technology.

And that's why Google, Microsoft, all these

big companies are all getting involved.

I hope you see that.

I hope you don't miss.

They're not doing this for fun.

They don't want to lose money.

They want to make money.

They want to continue their market

dominance and maintain market share.

And they see the technology and the disruption that's

happening, so they're trying to adapt to it or

if they don't, they will have their blockbuster moment.
