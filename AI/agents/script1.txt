I've got big news for you.

Gary Genser Scumbag regulator Gary Genser sends a

wells notice to another crypto company just days

ahead of the election and another investment firm

has filed for an XRP spot etf.

This is a spit in the face of Gary Genser and one

of the largest banks in the world is tokenizing on Ethereum.

I'll share the details with you.

Let's get into it.

Folks, I want to highlight something here.

This past week we saw record breaking buying

of the Bitcoin ETF, especially from BlackRock.

Well, Matt Hogan of Bitwise

Asset Management highlighted the following.

He said here are the total net flows

since inception of the largest gold and Bitcoin

ETFs for gold he highlighted $20.9 billion.

It was launched in November 2004.

Now just BlackRock's IBIT Bitcoin ETF $25.8 billion.

It was just launched in January of this year, 2024.

Obviously not even a year has passed

and it has blown past gold's number.

Guys, we are seeing record breaking demand for these ETFs

and it shows this asset class is here to stay.

People recognize it's the future and it's blowing

all the ETF records out of the water.

The guys who have been in the ETF business for a long

time, like Matt and others, they are blown away by this.

It's incredible folks.

This is why I'm so bullish.

Despite the volatility we're seeing right now in

the market, guys, there's just incredible demand.

And here's another example.

Florida's chief financial officer says the state holds

over $800 million in crypto related investments.

What we've been seeing is since the etf' have

been introduced, many of these states and local Governments

across the US are finding it easy to buy

the ETFs and diversify into Bitcoin and crypto because

the ETFs reduce the risk.

It makes it safer, it makes it easier for them.

We've been hearing about state pension funds, endowments

and much more buying up the Bitcoin ETFs.

Guys, it's incredible what's happening and

it's what we've been talking about.

If you have blackrock, the world's wealthiest asset

manager, launching these products, getting involved, it gives

confidence to people to start investing in it.

So we've crossed the chasm, guys.

Crypto has gone mainstream, it's become ubiquitous.

Like I've been saying, it's in

politics, tradfi, pop culture, society, right?

People are waking up to what's happening here.

And you and I are the early adopters.

We've been here for years buying the bloody

bear market, buying the dips and being patient.

And speaking of being patient, the market

right now is really volatile, right?

Bitcoin is retesting some support levels, but the higher

highs and higher lows have not been invalidated with

this move out of this accumulation boring zone.

So bitcoin pulling back to below 70k, but

as you can see here, still holding support

levels, still forming a higher low.

Now I've been telling you guys, there's going to be a

lot of volatility as it heads up to the election.

And the election uncertainty needs to be cleared out

the way for the markets to blast off.

We've seen this historically.

Right now people are not focused on investing,

they're focused on politics, who's going to be

the president and yada yada, right?

So once it's out of the way, it's cleared

out, we're going to see the markets move.

So I'm excited for next week, for the

election to be over, uh, but things are

moving in the right direction here.

One analyst highlighted that bitcoin is forming a

massive cup and handle on its chart here.

Um, this is the one week

chart and it's looking very bullish.

And he said the target is $123,000.

Now I hope bitcoin goes higher, uh,

you know, because I hold bitcoin.

But also it will, it will allow more

liquidity to flow down to the altcoins.

So I think it will.

But the question is how high?

That's hard to predict, right?

But guys, I think we can definitely book it

that bitcoin's going to crack $100,000 this cycle.

Now I always want to caveat that by saying

that's a, we're talking probabilities, not guarantees or certainties

because no one has a crystal ball.

But based on the data, based on the charts, the

macro and so forth, we can form a thesis.

Moving ahead, guys, this is interesting.

Argentina's central bank becomes the first financial institution

to host a live bitcoin mining exhib.

How times have Changed.

You got a central bank displaying bitcoin mining.

That is fascinating to me, guys.

And once again, crypto becoming ubiquitous.

It is everywhere now, and I believe central

banks will hold bitcoin in the future.

I don't think it happens overnight, but if

you have Wall street embracing bitcoin and hoarding

it, and then you have presidential candidates like

Donald Trump and even people in the Senate

like Senator Cynthia Lummis proposing that the United

States use bitcoin as a Treasury reserve asset,

you see the direction we're headed in, right?

It will take time.

It won't happen overnight.

Like I said, we're headed to the full

embrace of this technology and asset class.

It's pretty amazing.

Now, speaking of Donald Trump, Yesterday was Bitcoin's

16th anniversary and a man tweeted out, I

would like to wish our great Bitcoiners A

happy 16th anniversary of Satoshi's white paper.

We will end Kamala's war in crypto and

bitcoin will be made in the U.S. vote Trump. Now.

He made it political.

Obviously, he's been campaigning on crypto.

But for those of you who don't like

Donald Trump, whether you love or hate him,

don't get blinded by the person himself.

But the fact that this is a

former president and a current presidential candidate

is tweeting about bitcoin and crypto.

Look at where we've come from and

look at where we're at, guys.

It's amazing.

This is why I'm bullish. Once again.

It doesn't matter if you hate Donald

Trump or you're voting for Kamala Harris.

That's your business.

But I don't want you to miss how significant

this is if you put your political bias aside.

Right, that we are seeing a full embrace of crypto.

It's amazing what's happening now.

Check this news out.

21 shares looks to secure SEC approval for XRP

ETF amid growing interest in other crypto funds.

So, guys, this makes three filers for XRP spot ETFs.

So they filed an S1 registration

statement with the SEC today. Incredible.

This is a spit in the

face of scumbag dirty Gary Genser.

Because despite the ongoing litigation between Ripple

and the sec, the judge declared clear

that XRP intrinsically is not a security.

And I think these firms recognize that.

Gary's last days are here.

He's going to be kicked out of office

regardless of if Trump or Harris wins.

Now, it's not 100% guaranteed if Harris wins

that she's going to kick him out.

But we know for sure if Donald Trump

wins, they're going to kick him out.

And I think, like I said, these companies are,

this is kind of like a call option.

They're, they're anticipating him getting kicked out.

So it's pretty amazing.

Ripple CEO Brian Garlinghouse tweeted out about it.

He said the message from the market is clear.

Institutional interest in XRP products

is stronger than ever.

Bitwise canary funds and 21 shares

have filed for their S1s.

He highlighted that Grayscale relaunched their XRP trust, but

they haven't filed for an XRP spot ETF yet.

Now, I will be interviewing the head

of research at Grayscale next week.

I'm going to ask the question when XRP spot

ETF filing and of course, many other questions.

So make sure you're subscribed with the notification.

Bell turned on. Guys.

Now check this bullish news out. Guys.

I am blown away by the number

of banks, financial institutions, global powerhouses that

are getting involved in crypto.

So UBS Asset Management launches

its first tokenized investment fund.

This first fund, a money market investment

built on Ethereum distributed ledger technology, will

be available through authorized distribution partners.

Guys, do you see what's happening?

And the majority of the masses

are missing things like this.

They're going about watching their TV shows

and Netflix and caught up with politics.

And don't get me wrong, it's okay to watch TV shows,

it's okay to vote and do what you got to do.

But financial education is so important if you're

trying to get more freedom for yourself.

Now, if you're already a billionaire and

you don't care, then that's fine.

But a majority of people are looking for ways

to get out of poverty, improve their financial situation.

With the economy the way it is, and

they're missing the opportunity of a lifetime.

They would rather watch a Netflix show than

be researching and learning about what's happening.

Guys.

And this is incredible.

Don't miss how big this is.

The largest institution, stock markets, banks

and much more are getting involved.

They're launching financial products, they're tokenizing,

they're testing, they're using stable coins.

It's amazing.

So UBS Asset Management today announces the launch

of UBS USD Money Market Investment Fund Token

umint, a money market investment built on Ethereum.

Here's a quote.

We are seeing growing investor appetite for

tokenized financial assets across asset classes.

Through leveraging our global capabilities and collaborating

with peers and regulators, we can now

provide clients with an innovative solution.

This comes from Thomas Kagi Co Head of the

UBS Asset Management APAC Guys when I see stuff

like this it makes me so bullish and I

wish other people were paying attention.

But you know what's going to happen.

As I've talked about many times, those who

are not financially educated, they end up fomoing

in and coming in at the top and

they get categorized into the dumb money crowd.

Don't be dumb money, be smart money. Research.

Buy to Lowe's, take your position and be patient.

You guys know how it works.

A great place where you can buy Ethereum and

Altcoins and other and Bitcoin is on Uphold.

It's a platform I've been using since 2018.

They have 300 plus cryptocurrencies.

They're available in over 150 countries guys.

And best of all they are

safe and trustworthy once again.

I've been using them for many years.

I've interviewed their CFO, their CEO

and they are 100% reserved.

They don't commingle or lend out your crypto funds and

they have a transparency report that you can review.

So it's really easy to use Uphold.

They have a great app, great platform and much more.

If you'd like to learn more about

Uphold, visit the link in the description.

Now dirty scumbag regulator Gary Genser

is up to his tricks again.

They have sent a Wells notice to Immutable.

Now you may say who the hell is Immutable?

Well they are a leading platform

for building Web3 games on Ethereum.

So Genser even a days ahead of

the election is still doing this nonsense.

This guy has to be kicked out is pathetic and I'm

not even going to read through all of it guys.

Because it you know what it is Gary?

Making up crap in sending Wells notices.

And usually when you get a Wells notice it

means a lawsuit is most likely going to follow.

Here's what Kristen Smith of the Blockchain association

said the SEC's regulation by enforcement campaign under

SEC Chair Gary Genser isn't slowing down.

The most recent target, Immutable, received a Wells

notice within hours of engaging with the sec,

the latest in a long line of American

crypto companies under assault by the agency.

Fortunately, like so many other companies in our

industry, Immutable plans to fight these allegations.

The significant downside is that their defense

will add to the ever growing amount

of legal expenses wasted fighting SEC overreach.

So the Blockchain association actually

launched a website tracking this.

The amount of money being spent in legal fees

to fight the SEC and it's over $430 million.

Now, they, they said this number is

actually conservative because they don't have the

entire industry submitting all the information, only

the members of the blockchain association.

So you can imagine those who have been fighting

who are not part of the association and the

amount of legal fees they've had to put out.

Even Ripple just alone had to spend $100 million.

And not to mention the waste of taxpayer money

that, you know, that the SEC is using.

And many of these lawsuits are unlawful.

So this is why I call Gary Genser a scumbag regulator.

And the fact that he's doing this just days ahead of

the election, this guy's got to get kicked out, man.

One thing we've been seeing, though, is

that the crypto industry is spending a

lot of money in this election cycle.

So as some folks have reported, the upcoming

Congress will be the most pro crypto.

And a lot of the anti crypto army people are

losing the elections and they're probably pretty pissed off at

Elizabeth Warren for, you know, doing this nonsense, forming the

anti crypto army and campaigning on that.

And remember, remember, John Deaton

is running against Elizabeth Warren.

If you are in the state of Massachusetts,

do yourself a favor and vote John Deaton.

Kick out Warren.

And if you're outside the state of

Massachusetts, donate to John Deaton, guys.

So the SEC continues their nonsense,

but it's not just the sec.

We know that Elizabeth Warren has her cronies in

different parts of the government, in different agencies such

as the treasury, the Fed, and so forth.

Paul Graval, chief legal Officer at Coinbase,

gave an update here of the lawsuit.

They sent a file against the FDIC over

a FOIA request and they're starting to get

information and it's giving confirmation that there was

indeed a Operation Chokepoint 2.0 agenda.

Paul says, slowly but surely,

the picture is becoming clearer.

After we sued, the FDIC finally started giving

us information related to our FOIA request about

the pause letters it sent to financial institutions

as part of Operation Chokepoint 2.0.

In short, the contents are a shameful example

of a government agency trying to cut off

financial access to law abiding American companies.

So far, we've uncovered more than 20 examples of

the FDIC telling banks to pause or refrain from

providing or not proceed with offering crypto banking services.

The public deserves transparency, not an agency

that's working behind a bureaucratic curtain.

We don't have the full letters yet, but

what we've seen so far speaks volumes.

Take a Look for yourself.

In the meantime, we'll keep pushing to

get the clarity from our regulators through

FOIA requests and any other means necessary.

So it takes a lawsuit to get stuff.

They don't even respond to FOIA requests,

which is the Freedom of Information Act. It's pathetic.

The SEC does the same thing.

They're just blocking it. I know.

There's a larger problem here.

These government agencies have become rogue.

They've gotten too powerful. Right.

Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

So we need to take these people to the

courts, and that's where we're getting our victories, because

the checks and balances, it's working out here.

And that's the great thing about the United States.

And we have our government set up.

It's not perfect, but at least

we can get things done here.

And we can expose Elizabeth Warren and

her cronies and scumbags like Gary Genser.

All right, Moving ahead, guys.

Crypto.com announces acquisition of SEC registered

broker dealer Watchdog Capital LLC.

So we continue to see many of

these crypto companies are doing mergers, acquisitions,

expanding, trying to build their businesses globally.

And it's a race.

It's an arms race right now, and

it's pretty amazing to watch it happen.

And, you know, recently we had the

biggest acquisition in the crypto industry, where

Stripe bought Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure company,

for over a billion dollars. That's.

That's pretty incredible.

So crypto.com is trying to expand its services here.

So this is pretty cool.

Paxos launches a new USD

stablecoin with Singapore's DBS Bank.

So Paxos helps, helps different

folks to launch stable coins.

They help PayPal to launch their PyUSD.

I'll be interviewing the CEO of

Paxos again very soon, Charles Cascarilla.

I interviewed him years ago, so I'll get you guys

as much updates around these things, but pretty incredible.

So it says here the new stablecoin

will be compliant with Singapore's regulatory framework.

So we're seeing legislation not banning, but legislation

embracing the technology, putting the guardrails in place

to protect consumers, but also foster innovation.

If only we can get that in the

United States, and I think we will.

There's more bipartisan support now, Democrats and Republicans

working in Congress to get legislation through.

Now, guys, Tether continues to

make epic revenue and profit.

So tether registers $2.5 billion in net profit for

Q3, bringing year to date total to $7.7 billion.

This is huge.

And this is why you can imagine there's a lot

of, of competitors who want to take Tether down?

There's the Wall street crowd.

Who wants to take Tether down?

You think Jamie Dimon and

JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, blackrock.

These guys like this, they want that money.

They used to make that money.

Now it's leaving their funds, right?

But that's why they're embracing crypto

and trying to catch up.

It's incredible the paradigm shift

that's taking place here.

But I mean, this is crazy profit.

This is not even just revenue, this is profit.

Imagine making billions in a quarter in profit.

This, this is nuts, man.

And look, everybody's going to try to come

for a slice of this pie, right? That's why you have so

many stable coins being launched.

Solana launched a stable coin recently.

Ripple's going to Launch one.

Obviously PayPal has one and obviously USDC

is right on the tail of Tether.

They, they, they want to take them down for sure.

But incredible stuff, folks.

Just really think about this.

A stable coin issue, the largest in the world.

It made 2.5 billion in profit in one quarter and

bringing the total for the year to over 7 billion.

Can you imagine what their

cash reserves look like, man?

It's crazy.

Paulo Arduino, CEO Tether highlighted that Tether

has announced they're launching a Durham pegged

stablecoin on the ton blockchain.

So they continue to build and expand.

Obviously there's a lot of controversy around

Tether and what stablecoin legislation here in

the United States may do to Tether.

They may lose market share here, we don't know yet.

But in the eu, Tether got

kicked out from many exchanges.

So let's see what happens.

They are global.

So even if they get kicked out of the United States,

they are established globally, guys, so they are making a ton

of money and they are still the number one.

So over time I believe they're

going to lose market share.

But incredible, incredible stuff if you

really think about it, folks. That's the news.
